# GifGrab

GifGrab is an app powered by the GIPHY API that allows a user to retrieve 10 gifs at the click of a button.

The app is initialized with a few search topics (each a Nickelodeon cartoon!) The user is able to add more topics using the form and clicking the "Add topic" button. (The topic will also be added if the 'enter' key is pressed while in the text box.)

After the gifs are loaded, the user can click any of the resulting gifs to play the gif by changing the `src` of the image to the moving gif. When the user clicks a playing gif it will go back to a still image.

The rating is also displayed below the gif.

The page is styled using bootstrap allowing it to display well on mobile devices.

## Instructions

Click any of the topic buttons at the top of the screen to pull 10 gifs from GIPHY.

To add your own topic, enter one in the search bar and click "Add topic".

Click any of the gifs to play them.
